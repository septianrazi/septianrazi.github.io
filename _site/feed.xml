Developed using the Selenium library, the bot was run for an extended period collecting data from each post including the text, number of likes, number of comments and link to the post.
  I analysed the post frequency throughout the year, and found evidence of how the covid-19 pandemic had affected our online engagement. 
  I had also conducted linguistic analysis of the group, finding the most frequent words used in posts, the most liked posts, and the most popular emoji used.
  From this result, I had gained key insights in how my residential hall’s community uses this platform, and how our values and commuunity spirit eminates through these unconvered trends.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="project" /><category term="project" /><category term="SoftEng" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fenner Hall Symposium, ANU]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Fenner Survey Analytics</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/project/2021/12/30/fennerSymposium.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Fenner Survey Analytics" /><published>2021-12-30T00:00:00+11:00</published><updated>2021-12-30T00:00:00+11:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/project/2021/12/30/fennerSymposium</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/project/2021/12/30/fennerSymposium.html"><![CDATA[<p>I conducted an in-depth Data Analysis of our Annual Mid-Year Survey Data collected from 2013.
I performed Data Cleaning and Integration on over ten datasets with more than 200 entries each, 
and analysed the data using data mining techniques such as Frequent Pattern Mining.
From this result, I was able to provide statistical evidence that a certain demographic was being less engaged within the hall. 
This resulted in actual concrete changes to address this issue.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="project" /><category term="project" /><category term="SoftEng" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Fenner Hall Symposium, ANU]]></summary></entry></feed>
