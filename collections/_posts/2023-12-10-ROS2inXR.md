We developed a system that utilises the novel and unique interaction methods provided by the HoloLens 2 and translate it in an intuitive way to control a robot via ROS2, inspired by the interaction techniques from previous works. Such interactions include hand gestures and voice commands.

The system consists of a HoloLens 2 Application and an accompanying ROS2 node, which communicate to each other via an Flask API webserver. With this system, we also allow different ROS2 robots or XR devices to communicate with each other.
