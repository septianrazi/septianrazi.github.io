  I had designed and developed this website from scratch, only basing off of a a legacy pakdd website developed in the early 2000s. Design process included creating a new brand identity, and manifesting it into a colour scheme and a website mockup (using Figma). 
  
  Following on from that, development started by utilising bootstrap and jekyll, developing both the overall content structure and it's associated look. Utilising p5.js, I was able to add some interactivity. By utilising jekyll, it ensured that future stakeholders can easily update content without having to understand the technical details of it, since content is solely based on markdown files populated throughout.

  A login system was also required to allow committee members of the conference to distribute sensitive conference information, documents and guidelines. I implemented a bespoke login system using Google Firebase, that allowed user creation and login activites. This bespoke implementation also allowed stakeholders to configure users without having an understanding of technical details.
