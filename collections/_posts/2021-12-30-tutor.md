  I have tutored assembly programming and computer architecture (for COMP2300), Web Development and Design (for COMP1710) and Graphics (COMP1720) within ANU.
  With class sizes ranging from 10 - 40 Students, flexibility and adaptability is highly important when catering to multiple students from different backgrounds and capabilities.
  I also collaborate closely with my lecturers and other tutors in planning of the course and marking.
