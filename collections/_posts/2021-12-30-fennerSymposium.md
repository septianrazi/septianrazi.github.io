I conducted an in-depth Data Analysis of our Annual Mid-Year Survey Data collected from 2013.
I performed Data Cleaning and Integration on over ten datasets with more than 200 entries each, 
and analysed the data using data mining techniques such as Frequent Pattern Mining.
From this result, I was able to provide statistical evidence that a certain demographic was being less engaged within the hall. 
This resulted in actual concrete changes to address this issue.
