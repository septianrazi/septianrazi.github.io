  The SII website was initially developed by a third-party company utilising wordpress. This was then migrated into a basic HTML website outside of the wordpress ecosystem after several years. However, this transfer created significant difficulties in maintenance and updating. Many bespoke wordpress plugins converted to JavaScript files where tightly coupled with other files, and presented challenges to the team in updating the website.

  In an effort to alleviate this issue, I proposed cleaning up the website while updating it to utilise Jekyll as a content management system, as it allowed for basic markdown files to populate website content, making maintenance more user-friendly. Thus, I had removed any unnecessary wordpress plugins and other remnant JavaScript files, while ensuring the look and feel of the website was maintained. Adding on Jekyll support, the website is now in a stable condition with content updates more accessible for anyone within the team.
