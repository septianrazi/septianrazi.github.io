  Developed a system to allow graph visualisations to be transfered from a Python or Mathematica notebook on a Desktop to a XR application in a live and distributed manner.

  To accomplish this, I developed an XR application using Unity that polls a Firebase Cloud API. This cloud API stores the data format of a 3D graph.

  On the desktop side, we created a bespoke python notebook that allowed POSTing of 3D graph data from the desktop. This allows for the full functionality of mature data analytics tools within Python and Mathematica to be instantaneously transported into an Immersive setting.

  We had performed several expert user tests in a completely virtual manner through video conferencing. Our XR application is designed to supplement graph exploration tasks in this distributed setting.

  We compiled our findings into a paper for IEEE VR 2022, which was accepted as a poster.
