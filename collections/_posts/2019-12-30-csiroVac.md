For the 3 month-long program, I had developed an optimised and insightful visualisation of CSIRO pedigree data containing over 45,000 data entries into an interactive graph in 3D space.
I had modularised the software to function on multiple different hardware technologies including cutting-edge hardware such as the Hololens 2, Vive Pro, and Oculus Quest.
