  As one of my first projects when joining ANU SII, I had designed and developed the front end of the CRISPER website, which was previously a barebones CSS-less website.

  Design process involved creating an initial brand identity and logo for the CRISPER project, such that the website could reflect it. Choosing black, greys and yellows for the main colour scheme, I had designed a simple mockup using Figma.

  Following approval of the new design, I had begun work on the website. This was my first instance of using bootstrap for website development, and I was able to quickly pick it up and deliver outcomes instantly.

  Website front-end was complete and was integrated with dashboards and other software artifacts created by the team surrounding the CRISPER project.
