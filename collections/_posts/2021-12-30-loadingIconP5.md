  Side-project combining different cyclical loading animations developed using javascript and p5.
  Using different combinations of trigonometric functions on the translation, scaling and rotation on primitive p5 shapes, complex and visually appealing loading animations emerge.
  Changing the rate of change and opacity of background can offer further aesthetic animations.
