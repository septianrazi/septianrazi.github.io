  As part of my first project with ANU Techlauncher, we developed an API Test Client for Xero Canberra using Agile Methodologies. 
  I spearheaded the Iterative Design Process by creating mock-ups, performing User Evaluation Testing and documentation.
  I had also assisted the Front-End developers in translating this design into a workable product using React.
