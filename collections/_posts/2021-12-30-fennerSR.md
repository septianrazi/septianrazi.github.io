After having lived in Fenner Hall since day one of university, I am currently a Senior Resident here.
I operate as a support figure for the 42 residents on my floor, offering pastoral care and community building efforts.
I collaborate closely alongside a team of up to 40 other leaders, ensuring an inclusive and positive environment within the hall.
I am also involved in the International Portfolio, in which I help better assimilate International Students within our community.
