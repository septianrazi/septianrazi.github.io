Working with clients from Accenture, I lead and managed the development of a UI Prototype optimised for fatigued and high-risk workers in vehicles.
This involved managing a team of seven in delivering research, UI prototypes and testing alongside communicating with stakeholders.
Developed a Testing Environment using React alongside a basic UI Prototype for a Vehicle Dashboard.
