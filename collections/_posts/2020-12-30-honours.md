  Explored the use of Mixed Reality in Visualisation of Hierarchical Pedigree Graph Data.
  Developed several visualisation techniques alongside novel interaction techniques and
  conducted user study to measure effectivity of these methods. 
  Compiled findings into 70 page thesis and a poster for IEEE VR 2021.
