We develop a colour desnity visualisation using three js. In the program, we use webgl shaders to manipualte geometries and points to allow visualisation of colour in RGB, CIExyY and CIELab space. With a sample video, we are able to process the colour density and visualise it using graphs. 

We also add support to WebXR, allowing us to place visualisations in a XR environment as seen in the video.
