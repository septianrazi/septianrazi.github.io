  I lead a team of 15 committee members in creating events and projects throughout the year, representing over two hundred Indonesian Students at the ANU.
  Together, we held and planned our large annual event "Indonesian Folk Market" (Pasar Senggol) involving intense planning, effectively delegating around 50 volunteers and collaborating with the Indonesian Embassy and other societies. 
  This resulted in a hugely successful event with over 300 participants.
