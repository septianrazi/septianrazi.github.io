  I developed a web scraping bot to gather data from Fenner Hall's Facebook Group's posts. Developed using the Selenium library, the bot was run for an extended period collecting data from each post including the text, number of likes, number of comments and link to the post.
  I analysed the post frequency throughout the year, and found evidence of how the covid-19 pandemic had affected our online engagement. 
  I had also conducted linguistic analysis of the group, finding the most frequent words used in posts, the most liked posts, and the most popular emoji used.
  From this result, I had gained key insights in how my residential hall's community uses this platform, and how our values and commuunity spirit eminates through these unconvered trends.
