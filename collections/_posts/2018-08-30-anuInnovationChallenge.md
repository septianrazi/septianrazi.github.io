As part of the ANU Innovation Challenge, we were tasked to design innovative solutions to tackle water shortages around the world.
We proposed a design for a smart water monitoring system with social and gamification aspects to it, 
allowing users not only to monitor their usage, but incentivising further water usages via social and gamification features.
We were awarded the best solution for this challenge.
