  As part of a team of five, we developed an innovative product that allowed people to determine job prospects and future growth within geographic constraints. 
  We utilised multiple publicly accessible data and developed a machine learning model to predict jobs in the future, connecting it with a web front-end via Flask. 
  As a result of our 48 Hours of Coding, we were shortlisted for the Western Australia Awards and received Runner Up for the International Awards.
